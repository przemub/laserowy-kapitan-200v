# laserowy-kapitan-200v

Laserowy Kapitan 200V is a Markov chain based text generator designed to algorithmically create new episodes of the Polish adult TV cartoon *Kapitan Bomba*. Among its main features is the possibility of mixing in other works by Mr Walaszek, including *Laserowy gniew dzidy* and *Kaliber 200 volt*, so as to create cross-over episodes. The tool is highly dependent on its sister project, [kapitan-bomba-transcript](https://github.com/Lachcim/kapitan-bomba-transcript).
